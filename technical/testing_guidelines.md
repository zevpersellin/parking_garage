Of course. Here is a detailed testing strategy from a QA perspective, structured around the testing pyramid to ensure comprehensive quality for the Parking Garage API exercise.

### **Testing Strategy: Parking Garage API v1.0**

* **Version:** 1.0
* **Status:** Proposed
* **Author:** QA Team

---

### **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the testing strategy for the **Parking Garage Management API**. The goal is to ensure the application is reliable, functional, and meets all specified requirements. We will adopt the **Testing Pyramid** model to create a fast, efficient, and robust testing suite. This approach emphasizes testing components in isolation at the lower levels and validating full workflows at the top.

### **2. Level 1: Unit Tests**

**Goal:** To verify that individual components and functions (business logic) work correctly in isolation. These tests are fast, easy to maintain, and form the foundation of our testing suite.

**Scope:**
* Service layer classes and business logic.
* Utility functions.
* Data model validation.

**Key Scenarios to Test:**
* **Spot Assignment Logic:**
    * Given an empty garage, the `findAvailableSpot` method should return the first available spot.
    * Given a full garage, the `findAvailableSpot` method should correctly signal that no spots are available (e.g., throw an exception or return an empty optional).
* **Car Check-In/Check-Out Logic:**
    * [cite_start]Verifying that the `checkInCar` service method correctly creates a `Car` record with the proper timestamp[cite: 39, 42].
    * Verifying that the `checkOutCar` service method correctly identifies the spot to be freed.
* **Rate Calculation (Stretch Goal):**
    * Given a car parked for exactly one hour, the fee calculation should be precise.
    * Test edge cases: a car parked for zero or negative time should result in a zero fee.
* **Spot/Car Compatibility (Stretch Goal):**
    * [cite_start]An oversized car should not be assigned to a compact spot[cite: 48, 49].
    * A compact car should be assignable to a standard or oversized spot.

### **3. Level 2: Integration Tests**

**Goal:** To verify that different layers of the application interact correctly. These tests ensure that data flows properly between the controllers, services, and the data repository.

**Scope:**
* Interaction between the Controller and Service layers.
* Interaction between the Service and Repository (in-memory data store) layers.

**Key Scenarios to Test:**
* **Check-In Flow:**
    * When the `check-in` service method is called, does it correctly call the `update` method on the `ParkingSpotRepository` to change the spot's status?
* **Check-Out Flow:**
    * When a car is checked out through the service, verify that the corresponding `ParkingSpot` record in the repository is updated to `available`.
* **Data Integrity:**
    * After a spot is marked as occupied, ensure it no longer appears in the list returned by the repository's `findAvailableSpots` method.

### **4. Level 3: API / End-to-End Tests**

**Goal:** To validate the full functionality of the application from an external user's perspective by making HTTP calls to the running API endpoints. These tests mimic real-world usage.

**Scope:** All public API endpoints.

**Key Scenarios to Test:**

* **`POST /cars/check-in`**
    * **Happy Path:** Send a request with a new license plate. Assert a `201 Created` status and that the response contains the assigned spot details. Follow up with a `GET /spots/{spotId}` call to confirm the spot's status is `occupied`.
    * **Negative Path:** If the garage is full, assert a `409 Conflict` status and a descriptive error message.

* **`POST /cars/check-out`**
    * **Happy Path:** First, check a car in. Then, send a request to check out that same car. Assert a `200 OK` status. Follow up with a `GET /spots/{spotId}` call to confirm the spot's status is now `available`.
    * **Negative Path:** Attempt to check out a car by providing a license plate that does not exist in the system. Assert a `404 Not Found` status.

* **`GET /spots` and `GET /spots/available`**
    * **Initial State:** Before any cars are checked in, `GET /spots` should show all spots as `available`, and its result should be identical to `GET /spots/available`.
    * **Partial State:** After checking in one car, `GET /spots/available` should return one less spot than `GET /spots`.
    * **Full State:** After filling every spot, `GET /spots/available` should return an empty list.

* **`GET /cars/{license_plate}` (Stretch Goal)**
    * **Happy Path:** Check a car in, then call this endpoint with its license plate. Assert a `200 OK` status and that the response contains the correct car and spot information.
    * **Negative Path:** Call this endpoint with a license plate that is not checked in. Assert a `404 Not Found` status.
